/*
 * Optional (non-Sizzle) selector module for custom builds.
 *
 * Note that this DOES NOT SUPPORT many documented jQuery
 * features in exchange for its smaller size:
 *
 * Attribute not equal selector
 * Positional selectors (:first; :eq(n); :odd; etc.)
 * Type selectors (:input; :checkbox; :button; etc.)
 * State-based selectors (:animated; :visible; :hidden; etc.)
 * :has(selector)
 * :not(complex selector)
 * custom selectors via Sizzle extensions
 * Leading combinators (e.g., $collection.find("> *"))
 * Reliable functionality on XML fragments
 * Requiring all parts of a selector to match elements under context
 *   (e.g., $div.find("div > *") now matches children of $div)
 * Matching against non-elements
 * Reliable sorting of disconnected nodes
 * querySelectorAll bug fixes (e.g., unreliable :focus on WebKit)
 *
 * If any of these are unacceptable tradeoffs, either use Sizzle or
 * customize this stub for the project's specific needs.
